# Getting started

From an empty app to a screenshot. Every step here uses the defaults; the
other pages cover what to change.

## 1. Install

In the app that owns the pages. In a monorepo, each app gets its own install
and its own config.

```bash
pnpm add -D @playwright/test snapseq
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

The browser install is once per machine. Under Node 26 it hangs; run it with
Node 22 (`nvm use 22`). The `prepare` script builds `dist/` on install, so no
build output is committed.

Without access to the registry, vendor it instead: run `pnpm build` in a
checkout, copy `dist/`, `README.md` and `package.json` (without `scripts`,
`devDependencies` and `files`) into the consumer, e.g. `vendor/snapseq`, and
depend on it with `"snapseq": "file:../../vendor/snapseq"`.

## 2. Add the script

```json
{
  "scripts": { "screenshot": "snapseq" }
}
```

## 3. Write the config

`snapseq.config.ts` beside `package.json`:

```ts
// snapseq.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "snapseq";

export default defineConfig({
  envs: {
    dev: { host: "http://localhost:3000", webServer: "pnpm dev" },
  },
});
```

`host` is the base URL every capture navigates from. `webServer` is the
command that serves it: snapseq starts it before the run if nothing answers
at `host` yet, and stops it after. Leave `webServer` out to run against a
server you start yourself.

Two devices come by default, `desktop` (1920 × 1080) and `mobile` (390 × 844
at 2x, touch). [Config](config.md#devices) covers changing them.

## 4. Write a capture

One file per capture in `captures/`. The file name is the capture name.

```ts
// captures/pricing.capture.ts
import { capture, disableTransitions } from "snapseq";

capture(async ({ page, seq }) => {
  await disableTransitions(page);   // freeze animations, once per capture
  await page.goto("/pricing");      // relative to host
  await seq.snap();                 // 001.png  the viewport
  await seq.snapPage();             // 002.png  the whole page
});
```

`page` is Playwright's. `seq` numbers the shots: `snap` is the viewport,
`snapPage` the whole page. Both wait for the page to be ready first: DOM quiet,
fonts in, images loaded. [Captures](captures.md) covers the other fixtures and
the waits.

## 5. Run

```bash
pnpm screenshot
```

Every capture runs on every device, one at a time. The terminal shows one line
per capture and device, updated in place as the run goes. When the run ends
the run directory opens in Finder (Explorer on Windows).

```
  ✔ pricing / desktop  2 shots  3.1s
  ✔ pricing / mobile   2 shots  3.4s

  2 passed  4 shots  .screenshots/2026-10-01 at 4.07.16 PM
```

## 6. Find the shots

```
.screenshots/                          gitignored by snapseq itself
  2026-10-01 at 4.07.16 PM/            one directory per run, local time
    pricing/
      desktop/
        001.png
        002.png
        shots.txt                      one line per shot: file and URL
      mobile/
        001.png
        002.png
        shots.txt
```

- One capture, one device, another env: [Running](running.md).
- A menu that opens, a tray that docks, a state that loads late: [Examples](examples.md).
- A shot that looks wrong: [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
