# Running

```bash
pnpm screenshot                              # every capture, every device
pnpm screenshot pricing                      # captures whose path matches "pricing"
pnpm screenshot pricing --device mobile
pnpm screenshot --env staging                # or SNAPSEQ_ENV=staging

SNAPSEQ_RUN=review-1 pnpm screenshot      # name the run dir instead of the timestamp
pnpm screenshot --headed                     # also --ui, --debug, --trace on, --reporter json
pnpm screenshot --help
```

From a monorepo root: `pnpm --filter <app> screenshot pricing --device desktop`.

`snapseq` translates its own flags, finds `snapseq.config.ts` in the
current directory (or takes `-c <path>`), and hands everything else to
`playwright test`. So `--headed`, `--ui`, `--debug`, `--trace on`,
`--reporter json`, `--max-failures 0` and the rest work as in Playwright.

## Flags and variables

| Flag                  | Variable          | Effect                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[filter...]`         |                   | Playwright's file filter: captures whose path matches.                                        |
| `--env <name>`        | `SNAPSEQ_ENV`  | The env from the config. Default: `defaultEnv`, else `dev`, else the first.                   |
| `--host <url>`        | `SNAPSEQ_HOST` | Override that env's host for this run. Its `webServer` is then not started.                   |
| `--device <name>`     |                   | Only this device; repeatable. Playwright's `--project`.                                       |
| `-c, --config <path>` |                   | The config file. Default: `./snapseq.config.{ts,mts,cts,js,mjs,cjs}`.                      |
|                       | `SNAPSEQ_RUN`  | The run directory's name. Default: the local time the run started. A name, not a path.        |

The flag wins over the variable. An empty value (`--env ""`) means unset.

## Run directories

Every run gets its own directory named for the local time it started
(`2026-10-01 at 4.07.16 PM`), shared by all captures in that run:

```
.screenshots/
  2026-10-01 at 4.07.16 PM/
    pricing/desktop/001.png
    pricing/desktop/002.png
    pricing/desktop/shots.txt
    pricing/mobile/…
    campaign/landing/desktop/…
```

Within a run, a capture's `<capture>/<device>` directory is wiped when that
capture starts. So the run name and the device names must be directory names,
not paths, and a directory outside the screenshots dir is never wiped.
Retries and `--repeat-each` are rejected because a second run would overwrite
the first.

`shots.txt` in each directory lists every file with the URL it was taken at
and, when a readiness wait ran out, what was still pending:

```
001.png  http://localhost:3000/pricing
002.png  http://localhost:3000/pricing
003.png  http://localhost:3000/pricing/team  2 images still loading after 5 s
```

## Rerunning

`pnpm screenshot --last-failed` reruns the captures that failed last time. It
is not a resume: with `maxFailures: 1` the captures that never ran are not
included, and a rerun capture starts from `001.png` again. Set
`SNAPSEQ_RUN=<that run>` to write into the same run directory; only the
rerun capture's own directory is wiped.

```bash
SNAPSEQ_RUN="2026-10-01 at 4.07.16 PM" pnpm screenshot --last-failed
```

[Example 11](examples.md#11-rerun-one-capture-into-the-same-run) walks through it.

## Timeouts

The timeout (10 min, Playwright's `timeout`) is the time allowed between
shots, not per capture: every shot moves the deadline, so a capture of any
length passes as long as it keeps landing shots, and one that hangs dies 10
minutes after its last. The terminal then says `No shot for 10 min.` The
number in Playwright's own "Test timeout of … exceeded" is the time since the
capture started.

A `goto` is bounded separately, at 120 s (`navigationTimeout`), and every
click, fill and wait at 30 s (`actionTimeout`).
[Config](config.md#playwright-defaults) lists them all.

## When a capture fails

A capture that fails or times out leaves `failed.png` beside the shots it did
take: the page as the teardown found it, when it can still be shot (5 s at
most). `shots.txt` gets a `failed.png` line with that URL, and the terminal
names that page as where it died. The run stops there (`maxFailures: 1`);
`--max-failures 0` runs the rest.

## The terminal

An interactive run draws one live frame, redrawn in place: a header with the
env, host, run and elapsed time; one line per capture and device in the order
the run takes them, each changing in place like a todo list; and a footer.

```
  snapseq  dev  http://localhost:3000  2026-10-01 at 4.07.16 PM  00:14

  ✔ home / desktop     3 shots  4.2s
  ✔ home / mobile      3 shots  4.9s
  ⠋ pricing / desktop  2 shots  00:05  /pricing/team
  . pricing / mobile   queued
  - landing / mobile   skipped  desktop only

  2 passed, 1 skipped  8 shots  .screenshots/2026-10-01 at 4.07.16 PM
```

A row is queued, running (shots so far, how long, the path of the last shot),
passed (shots and duration), failed (where it died and the first error line),
or skipped (the reason). Shots are discovered as a capture runs, so there is
no total to count towards; progress is captures done out of captures planned.
A list longer than the terminal scrolls with the work, with a line each for
what is hidden above and below.

When the run ends the frame is replaced by a summary with every row, full
error messages and the run directory, and that directory opens in Finder
(Explorer on Windows, the desktop's file manager on Linux). Only an
interactive run does this; pipes and CI never get a window. Resizing the
terminal mid-run freezes the frame as it is: every finished row is printed
under it in full, and the rest follow one line per event.

Before the first capture, while Playwright brings up the env's dev server, one
line says what the run is waiting for and for how long:
`waiting for http://localhost:3002  pnpm dev  00:14`. It appears after the
first second, so a server that is already up never shows it.

Passed is green, failed red, rows that did nothing are dimmed; `NO_COLOR` or
`FORCE_COLOR=0` drops the colors. A terminal that cannot draw the marks (the
Linux console, Windows outside Windows Terminal) gets words instead: `ok`,
`FAIL`, `skip`.

When stdout is not a terminal (CI, a pipe, `--list`, `--debug`) the run uses
Playwright's list reporter with one line per shot, file and URL, instead.
`--reporter list` or any other reporter flag overrides the default either way.
